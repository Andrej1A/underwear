============================
Why Create Underwear?
============================
I build a lot of Django projects and I needed an easy way to deploy them to
a traditional virtual private server stack instead of just defaulting to
Heroku. I previously wrote extensive Fabric scripts to automate the
server configuration and deployment process, but those scripts were very 
difficult to maintain.
